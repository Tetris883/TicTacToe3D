# TicTacToe3D
A 3D TicToeGame implementation using C language which uses the fundamentals of a Magic Cube (A cube where the sum of numbers along any line, edge or diagonal has the same sum).

## Rules

(1) The rules are rather same as that of the basic version of the game (the 2D one). One needs connect three identical characters to claim a point.<br />
(2) To make sure the players get the chance to comeback, we allow the game to be carried till the cube is fully-filled OR till stalemate.
